# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a Python-based Tic Tac Toe game implementation.

## About

This program simulates a classic Tic Tac Toe game where two players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. The objective is to get three of your marks in a row, column, or diagonal.

## Game Rules

- Players take turns to place their marks ('X' or 'O') in empty spaces on the board.
- The game ends when one player gets three marks in a row, column, or diagonal, or when the board is filled without a winner (a draw).

## How to Play

1. Run the Python file `tic_tac_toe.py`.
2. Players take turns marking the locations by entering a number from 1 to 9 corresponding to the grid position.
3. The game announces the winner or declares a draw when the game ends.
